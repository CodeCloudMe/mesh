## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (needed for CLI)

## Basic Setup
	
We'll first kick things off by initializing our project. Call:

	latte bootstrap

In your CWD, which should be in your project directory. You can also call `latte bootstrap [path to project]`.

You can skip the obnoxious setup process if you want by calling `latte bootstrap --skip-setup`. 

the bootstrap script will produce a `manifest.json` file. It looks like this:

```javascript
{
	""
}
```
